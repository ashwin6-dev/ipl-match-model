# IPL Match Simulation

Under development.

Designed to use a machine learning model to predict ball-by-ball outcomes in order to simulate matches. 

This will be able to predict player performances, match outcomes and certain game events e.g who is most likely to score a 50 etc. Could also be used as an alternative to DLS.
